## Overview
RailEase is ready for mobile deployment using Capacitor. The app can be built as native Android and iOS applications.

## Prerequisites
- Node.js and npm installed
- For Android: Android Studio
- For iOS: Xcode (Mac only)

## Mobile App Setup Instructions

### 1. Export to GitHub
First, export this project to your GitHub repository using the "Export to Github" button in Lovable.

### 2. Clone and Setup
```bash
# Clone your repository
git clone <YOUR_GITHUB_REPO_URL>
cd rail-easy-seats

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the web app
npm run build
```

### 3. Initialize Capacitor (Already Done)
The Capacitor configuration is already set up in `capacitor.config.ts` with:
- App ID: `app.lovable.e3bf9350f7fe49de98a5b35c983e3fa6`
- App Name: `rail-easy-seats`
- Hot-reload enabled for development

### 4. Add Mobile Platforms

#### For Android:
```bash
npx cap add android
npx cap update android
npx cap sync android
```

#### For iOS:
```bash
npx cap add ios
npx cap update ios  
npx cap sync ios
```

### 5. Run on Device/Emulator

#### Android:
```bash
# Build and sync
npm run build
npx cap sync android

# Open in Android Studio
npx cap run android
```

#### iOS:
```bash
# Build and sync
npm run build
npx cap sync ios

# Open in Xcode
npx cap run ios
```

## Development Workflow

### Hot Reload Development
The app is configured to connect to the Lovable sandbox for hot reload during development:
- URL: `https://e3bf9350-f7fe-49de-98a5-b35c983e3fa6.lovableproject.com?forceHideBadge=true`
- This allows real-time updates while developing in Lovable

### Production Build
For production builds, update the `capacitor.config.ts`:
1. Remove or comment out the `server` section
2. Build and sync: `npm run build && npx cap sync`
